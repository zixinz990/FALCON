class Viewer:
    """This class handles controlling the camera associated with a viewport in the simulator.

    It can be used to set the viewpoint camera to track different origin types:

    - **world**: the center of the world (static)
    - **env**: the center of an environment (static)
    - **asset_root**: the root of an asset in the scene (e.g. tracking a robot moving in the scene)

    On creation, the camera is set to track the origin type specified in the configuration.

    For the :attr:`asset_root` origin type, the camera is updated at each rendering step to track the asset's
    root position. For this, it registers a callback to the post update event stream from the simulation app.
